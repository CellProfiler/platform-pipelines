==================

Our collection of standardized pipelines from the Imaging Platform.
- `cellpainting_20x_bin1`- pipelines for processing Cell Painting images. The analysis pipeline was customized for A549 cells imaged at 20x on Opera Phenix, without binning. The illumination pipeline requires that the image dimensions are a multiple of 10 because it downsamples and upsamples by a factor of 10.
