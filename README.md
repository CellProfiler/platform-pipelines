# Broad Imaging Platform pipelines

Cell Painting and other pipelines from the Imaging Platform.

**Note**: The `without_batchfile` version of a pipeline is identical to the version without the suffix, except that the `CreateBatchFiles` module is disabled. The `without_batchfile` version exists because [Distributed-CellProfiler](https://github.com/CellProfiler/Distributed-CellProfiler) currently does not support the use of batch files. When updating the pipeline, ensure that these two versions are always in sync.
